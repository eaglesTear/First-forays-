				</div>
				

		<p class="letter">This is my guide to the Scrin - a deadly alien faction in Command and Conquer 3.</p>
		
		<p class="letter">Arriving from deep across the vast expanse of space, the Scrin seek to harvest the tiberium they propagated with the asteroid sent towards Italy in 1995. After 20 years, the planet is sufficiently at war with itself and the tiberium covers most of the Earth, allowing the insect-like race to harvest their precious mineral.</p>

		<p class="letter">After several years of war with Earth, the Scrin have now divided into several factions:<br/></p>
			
				<ul class="letter">
				<li>Scrin Vanilla - unchanged and unified.</li></br>
				<li>Reaper-17 - The heavy shock troopers of the Scrin army.</li></br>
				<li>Traveller-59 - dangerously driven zealots who believe in subjugation rather than destruction.</li></br>
				</ul>
				
		
		<table class="letter" summary="A list of the Scrin factions, with strengths and weaknesses" title="Who does what?">
		<caption style="color: cyan">Overview of the Main Scrin Factions</caption>
		
			<tr>
				<th>/</th><th>Scrin</th><th>Reaper-17</th><th>Traveller-59</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Strength</th><td>Flexibility</td><td>Powerful on the ground</td><td>Fast, dangerous units</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Limitation</th><td>Prone to rushes</td><td>No airpower</td><td>High skill bar</td>
			</table>
			
			
			<p class="letter">So, without further hesitation, let's start with the unified, versatile and powerful main faction...</p>
	

	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h2>Scrin Vanilla</h2>
			</div>
				
				
	<div class="sub1 cent">			
		<img class="resize2" img src="http://www.cnclabs.com/cnc3/images/logos/AlienLogo_small.jpg" alt="Scrin logo" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="The badge of the invaders"/>
			</div>
			
			
		<p class="letter">The Scrin maintain access to nearly all of the homeworld's resources due to their unity, and thus have the widest range of units, abilities and support powers. This makes their flexibility in dealing with all factions very powerful. Scrin holds the most dangerous air power, and if left unchecked, their <em><strong>'victory fleets'</strong></em> can lay waste to a battlefield. The only unique units lacking here are Reaper Tripods and Shard Walkers, and Traveller's Cultists.</p> 
					
		
	<div class="sub1 cent under2">
		<h3>The Planetary Assault Carrier (PAC)</h3>
			</div>
				
		
	<div class="cent">   <!-- Why if I apply 'resize' here does it not work? But works inline below? Edit: img class refers to images and can't be applied in div class??? -->
		<img class="pac" img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/847092594063853792/AE30ACFD4B974FD64DFB08C07AD92409CB5E8D04/" alt="Image of a PAC" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="Capital-class punishment"/>
			</div>
	
			
		<p class="letter">Scrin's only <em><strong>Tier 4</strong></em> unit, at $3000 these bad boys don't come cheap, but once airborne their eight stratospheric drones will pull apart vehicles, structures and air units without compunction. The drones can be shot down, but as long as the <em><strong>PAC</strong></em>remains intact, they will all be rebuilt after 10 seconds or so. Scrin's PACS have access to the <em><strong>Forcefield Generators,</strong></em> making them immune to one EMP strike and enabling them to absorb extra damage.<br/>
		If this all doesn't quite seem enough, PACs can generate an <em><strong>Ion Storm</strong></em> at will, destroying units and ripping apart bases with savage arced thunderstrikes, while the carrier itself soaks it up - gaining armour buffs and regenerating properties while its enemies ride the lightning.</p>


	<div class="sub1 cent">
		<h3>Eradicator Hexapod</h3><p style="letter"><em>(Lifeform Recycling Unit)</em></p>
			</div>
		
		
	<div class="cent">
		<img class="hex" img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kylarsroleplay/images/d/dd/The_Scrin_Erradicator.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180223023710" alt="Image of Hexapod" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="This thing believes in recycling"/>
			<br/>
				</div>
					
					
		<p class="letter">The gargantuan <em><strong>Eradicator Hexapod</strong></em> walks around spewing plasma over any unit unfortunate enough to be in range. It will also crush everything in its path, and all casualties this thing inflicts means income generation - cash is accrued for each defeated unit, depending upon its value. The Hexapod can also be garrisoned: Disintegrators to take care of vehicles and structures, shock troopers for anti-air duties, and most importantly, the Prodigy for teleportation. Assign this monster a few Corruptors for healing, and combined with the Prodigy's teleport ability, it becomes immensely (and frustratingly) hard to kill.</p> 

					
	<div class="sub1 cent">
		<h3>The Mothership</h3>
			<img class="mship" img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/cnc/images/c/c1/TW_Mothership_Render.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140124073557" alt="Image of Mothership" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="It's the end of the world, as we know it"/>
				</div>
						
			
		<p class="letter">If this ends up above your base, say goodbye. The Mothership's <em><strong>Catalyst Cannon</strong></em> takes a few moments to charge, but upon release, any unit or structure caught in the blast will instantly be reduced to the molecular level - vaporised. The blast causes a chain reaction, so all units and structures will 'pass' the charge - meaning even the biggest of bases will quickly disappear. The Mothership must be directly above a target to fire. Sadly, a known bug in this game means that it doesn't always fire when ordered to, meaning it can be destroyed as a result...$5000 down the drain.</p>
		<p class="letter">However, when used strategically and with surprise, the Mothership is a game-changer and frankly, a game-ender.</p>


	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h4>Advanced Tactics</h4>
			</div>
			
			
		<p class="letter">As Scrin possess the most options of the 3 factions, they can theoretically come up with an answer for everything. Try a <em><strong>Seeker</strong></em> rush: Upgrade to <em><strong>Attenuated Forcefields</strong></em> and march about 5 of them into the enemy harvesting fields, dropping <em><strong>Reconstruction Drones</strong></em> to extend the longevity of your units. If the enemy is not prepared, this is a very difficult strategy to defend against.</p>
		<p class="letter">Don't use the <em><strong>Tiberium Asteroid</strong></em> on the enemy if you can help it. Use it instead on your own tiberium fields. Although $4000 in cost, it actually returns a greater yield of tiberium in the longer run, because it is seeded and grows at the same rate as the tiberium in regular fields.</p>


	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h3>Scrin Strengths & Limitations</h3>
			</div>
			
			
		<p class="letter">As mentioned before, Scrin's power lies in their adaptability. They do have answers for everything, lacking only the <em><strong>Reaper Shard Walker</strong></em> and <em><strong>Traveller's Cultist.</strong></em> However, they maintain the Shard Walker and Prodigy to serve essentially the same purpose, although somewhat less effectively.</p>
		<p class="letter">Scrin upgrades are expensive. Their <em><strong>Forcefield Generators</strong></em> cost $5000, double that of Reaper's. However, that upgrade does apply to their PACs and Devastators, making for the most powerful air fleet providing that there is enough economy to support it.<br/>  
		Bear in mind that Scrin can have a harder time dealing with rushes, as their <em><strong>Tier 1</strong></em> units are not as strong GDI's or Nod's. 


	<div class="sub1 under2 cent">
		<h2>The Cult of Reaper-17</h2> 
			<img src="https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/cnc_gamepedia_en/thumb/9/9f/Reap.jpg/300px-Reap.jpg?version=3ed2fa2000b6001d55fa3c070eccbc75" alt="Logo of Reaper-17" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="Another awesome logo" style="border: 4px solid purple"/>
				<br/>
					<br/>
						</div>
						

		<p class="letter">Reaper-17 are the shock troopers of the Scrin Invasion Force. They rely on raw power and have an insatiable thirst for tiberium. Some of their units are notably stronger and bigger than the vanilla Scrin army, and they can maintain and regrow their tiberium fields faster than any other faction.</p>
		<p class="letter">Let's run through the unique units of this dangerous cult...</p>  


	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h3>Shard Walker</h3>
			</div>
			
			
	<div class="cent">
			<img class="shard" img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kylarsroleplay/images/9/92/Scrin-gunwalker-1-.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170929014827" alt="Image of Shard Walker" title="Answer to manspam!" style="border: 4px solid purple;"/> 
				<br/>
					</div>
						

		<p class="letter">The Shard Walker is the more powerful version of the Scrin Gun Walker. It is excellent at soaking up rocket and gun damage, and it will rip infantry and air units to pieces. This unit can be upgraded with <em><strong>Blue Shards</strong></em> at the <em><strong>Tech Assembler</strong></em>, making it absolutely lethal against the aforementioned unit types.</p>


	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h4>Advanced Tactics</h4> 
			</div>


		<p class="letter">When dealing with mass infantry, such as Black Hand manspam, use the <em><strong>Phase Field</strong></em> on a group of your Shard Walkers and use them to crush. The Phase Field is made available with the <em><strong>Nerve Center</strong></em>.</p>


	<div class="sub1 cent under2">
		<h3>Reaper Tripod</h3>
			<img class="tripod"	img src="https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/cnc_gamepedia_en/thumb/2/2f/TW_Annihilator_forcefield.png/250px-TW_Annihilator_forcefield.png?version=7796f0855d8da660632f6c6bb372143b" alt="Image of Tripod" title="These things rock!" style="border: 4px solid purple"/>
				<br/>
					</div>


		<p class="letter">This is the most powerful form of the <em><strong>Annihilator Tripod</em></strong>. It is bigger, has more armour and can also be charged with tiberium for a massive damage boost. Many players do not take full advantage of the latter charging function, and it really should be used wherever possible. I know, nobody really wants one of the most powerful units in the game anyways, right? Reaper Tripods also EMP units at close range, and crush anything tier 2 and below. Their three tentacles can fire at three different targets simultaneously, but most of the time it is better to order focus fire on one specific unit or structure, thereby dealing more damage.</p>


	<div class="sub1 under2"> 
		<h4>Advanced Tactics</h4>
			</div>


		<p class="letter">Do not overlook the <em><strong>Conversion Reserves</em></strong> upgrade available at the <em><strong>Tech Assembler</strong></em>. This upgrade allows for extra charge on your Devourers and Tripods, meaning they can fire more tiberium-based shots and thus do more damage. It is cheap ($1500) and quick (1:00). Also, when using a group of Tripods, walk them closer to the enemy armies or structures in order to crush and EMP the shit out of them: Tripods can move whilst shooting.</p> 


	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h3>Reaper-17 Strengths & Limitations</h3>
			</div>


		<p class="letter">The units of Reaper-17 excel on the ground, and the faction contains some of the most powerful units in the game. The lust for tiberium allows units to deal extra damage and <em><strong>growth accelerators</strong></em> provide 15 credits of extra tiberium a second until destroyed or sold.</p> 
		<p class="letter">However, Reaper lacks some of the flexibility of the vanilla Scrin, meaning that certain unit combinations and adaptations are out. Certain support powers, such as the wormhole, are out. The <em><strong>Prodigy</strong></em> is absent also, and all this adds up to limited tactical, surprise and ambush options. With that said, Reaper excels being played with <strong>macro</strong> rather than <strong>micro</strong>, although a decent amount of micro is always useful. It is particularly noteworthy that Reaper also lacks access to the best of the Scrin's air power - only <em><strong>Stormriders</strong></em> are found in the <em><strong>Gravity Stabilisers</strong></em>, so wave goodbye to the <em><strong>Devastator Warships</strong></em> and <em><strong>Planetary Assault Carriers</strong></em>. No more melting your opponent's structures with plasma and deploying stratospheric drones to lay waste to GDI <em><strong>Mammoth Tanks.</strong></em></p>

		<h2>Traveller-59</h2>
			<img src="https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/cnc_gamepedia_en/thumb/d/d2/Travel.jpg/300px-Travel.jpg?version=a10cef8338457d9938d6ad533868b69c" alt="Traveller-59 logo" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="If you see this sign, you might want to wall-off your mind"/>
				</div>
			
			
		<p class="letter">Traveller-59 are the most fanatical faction to be found amongst the Scrin race. Traveller-59 seeks to control the very thoughts of its enemies, taking their minds rather than their lives. Motivated by an extremely religious mantra, Traveller-59 will use speed and surprise, taking over units and overwhelming their opponents with all sorts of trickery.</p>
		<p class="letter">Prepare to meet some of the abominations that await you if you dare go against this faction:</p>
					
					
	<div class="sub1">
		<h3>Cultists</h3> 
			<img src="http://cnc3.ru/files/images/kwidb/26.jpg" alt="Image of Cultists" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="These guys will piss you off"/> <br/>
				</div>
						
						
		<p class="letter">Any units unfortunate enough to get near the warped souls that are <em><strong>Cultists</strong></em> will instantly find themselves fighting for Traveller's cause. Almost nothing is safe. However, there are a few exceptions: Cultists cannot capture structures, air units, epic units or elite units such as the GDI or NOD <em><strong>Commando.</strong></em> <br/>
						  Be warned, however - just a few Cultists can capture your units at the worst possible time, and really turn the tide of a battle. That is what makes them so very scary.</p>


	<div class="sub1 cent">
		<h3>Mechapedes</h3> 
			<img class="mecha" img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/cnc/images/5/59/Scrin_Mechapede_hirez.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080208055630" alt="Image of Mechapedes" style="border: 4px solid purple;" title="Target the head or you will regret it"/>
				</div>
				
					
		<p class="letter">These centipede-like monstrosities start life as merely a head segment on emergence from the <em><strong>Warp Portal,</strong></em> but can be outfitted with up to eight more segments according to battlefield conditions. Choose between <em><strong>Shards, Discs, Toxins or Disintegrator </strong></em>components. These are good against vehicles or infantry, aircraft, structures and vehicles, respectively. Toxin segments can also be used to heal, just like the <em><strong>Corruptor.</strong></em></p>


	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h4>Advanced Tactics</h4>
			</div>


		<p class="letter">Traveller have a formidable rushing option. Follow this <em><strong>build order:</strong></em> power plant, portal, stasis chamber and then a refinery. Queue around 5 squads of disintegrators and at the same time activate the <em><strong>advanced articulators</strong></em> upgrade whilst simultaneously moving your units toward the enemy base. After 30 seconds your units will rocket across the map, and, with good micro, can deal irrecoverable damage to enemy harvesters. The advanced articulator upgrade also boosts the speed of Planetary Assault Carriers and Devastator Warships.</p>
		<p class="letter">If you have a <em><strong>Nerve Center,</strong></em> use the <em><strong>Temporal Wormhole</strong></em> support power to slow down all enemy units and structures within a large area. With drastically reduced fire rates, your units can easily turn the tide of battle. But <em><strong>be warned:</strong></em> don't get your own units caught in the area of effect - they will also suffer the same fate.</p>
		<p class="letter"><em><strong>Mothership Surprise:</strong></em> This tactic involves the use of the <em><strong>Prodigy, and ensure your foe doesn't have much in the way of anti-air defences.</strong></em> Have a <em><strong> Signal Transmitter</strong></em> queued, and capture any structure within your opponent's base with your Prodigy. Then, drop the Signal Transmitter next to the hijacked structure, and summon the <em><strong>Mothership.</strong></em> The Mothership appears wherever the signal transmitter is, so it will be right over the enemy base, allowing you to quickly charge the <em><strong>Catalyst Cannon</strong></em> and blast it into oblivion.</p>
		
	
	<div class="sub1 under2">
		<h3>Traveller-59 Strengths & Limitations</h3>
			</div>
	
	
		<p class="letter">Traveller's latent ability is only best drawn out with skill in micro-management. Individual units, such as the <em><strong>Cultist</strong></em>, must be handled carefully on an individual basis in order to get the most out of them and avoid expensive losses.</p>
		<p class="letter">Therefore, how powerful or not Traveller is becomes dependent very much on the skill of the user.</p>
