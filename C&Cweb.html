<p class="para">Welcome to my guide to one of the greatest games ever made.
I personally love the Scrin faction, namely Reaper-17 and Traveller-59. So, without further hesitation, let's start with one of the most capable ground fighting forces out of the 9 factions:</p>

<div class="sub1 under2 pic">
<h2>The Cult of Reaper-17</h2> 
<img src="https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/cnc_gamepedia_en/thumb/9/9f/Reap.jpg/300px-Reap.jpg?version=3ed2fa2000b6001d55fa3c070eccbc75" style="border: 3px solid green"/>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p class="para">Reaper-17 are the shock troopers of the Scrin Invasion Force. They rely on raw power and have an insatiable thirst for tiberium. Some of their units are notably stronger and bigger than the vanilla Scrin army, and they can maintain and regrow their tiberium fields faster than any other faction.</p>
<p class="para">Let's run through the unique units of this dangerous cult...</p>  

<div class="sub2 pic hover under2">
<h3>Shard Walker</h3>
<img class="resize2 "img src="http://community.tacticsoft.net/uploads/db9473/original/3X/d/c/dc67ebad4c080cbd87f4a5788e221a31254c6d48.jpeg" title="Really, a Corruptor!" style="border: 3px solid green;"/> 
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p class="para">The Shard Walker is the more powerful version of the Scrin Gun Walker. It is excellent at soaking up rocket and gun damage, and it will rip infantry and air units to pieces. This unit can be upgraded with <em><strong>Blue Shards</strong></em> at the <em><strong>Tech Assembler</strong></em>, making it absolutely lethal against the aforementioned unit types.</p>

<div class="sub2 under2">
<h4>Advanced Tactics</h4> 
</div>

<p class="para">When dealing with mass infantry, such as Black Hand manspam, use the <em><strong>Phase Field</strong></em> on a group of your Shard Walkers and use them to crush. The Phase Field is made available with the <em><strong>Nerve Center</strong></em>.</p>

<div class="sub2 pic under2">
<h3>Reaper Tripod</h3>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kylarsroleplay/images/1/19/Tripods.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171231051654" alt="These things rock!" style="border: 3px solid green"/>
<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<p class="para">This is the most powerful form of the <em>Annihilator Tripod</em>. It is bigger, has more armour and can also be charged with tiberium for a massive damage boost. Many players do not take full advantage of the latter charging function, and it really should be used wherever possible. I know, nobody really wants one of the most powerful units in the game anyways, right? Reaper Tripods also EMP units at close range, and crush anything tier 2 and below. Their three tentacles can fire at three different targets simultaneously, but most of the time it is better to order focus fire on one specific unit or structure, thereby dealing more damage.</p>

<div class="sub1 under2"> 
<h4>Advanced Tactics</h4>
</div>

<p class="para">Do not overlook the <em><strong>Conversion Reserves</em></strong> upgrade available at the <em><strong>Tech Assembler</strong></em>. This upgrade allows for extra charge on your Devourers and Tripods, meaning they can fire more tiberium-based shots and thus do more damage. It is cheap ($1500) and quick (1:00). Also, when using a group of Tripods, walk them closer to the enemy armies or structures in order to crush and EMP the shit out of them: Tripods can move whilst shooting.</p> 

<div class="sub2 under2">
<h3>Reaper Strengths & Limitations</h3>
</div>

<p class="para">The units of Reaper-17 excel on the ground, and the faction contains some of the most powerful units in the game. The lust for tiberium allows units to deal extra damage and <em><strong>growth accelerators</strong></em> provide 15 credits of extra tiberium a second until destroyed or sold.</p> 
<p class="para">However, Reaper lacks some of the flexibility of the vanilla Scrin, meaning that certain unit combinations and adaptations are out. Certain support powers, such as the wormhole, are out. The <em><strong>Prodigy</strong></em> is absent also, and all this adds up to limited tactical, surprise and ambush options. With that said, Reaper excels being played with <strong>macro</strong> rather than <strong>micro</strong>, although a decent amount of micro is always useful. It is particularly noteworthy that Reaper also lacks access to the best of the Scrin's air power - only <em><strong>Stormriders</strong></em> are found in the <em><strong>Gravity Stabilisers</strong></em>, so wave goodbye to the <em><strong>Devastator Warships</strong></em> and <em><strong>Planetary Assault Carriers</strong></em>. No more melting your opponent's structures with plasma and deploying stratospheric drones to lay waste to GDI <em><strong>Mammoth Tanks.</strong></em></p>
